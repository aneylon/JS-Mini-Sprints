# JS Mini Sprints
A repository of small scale projects to practice Test Driven Development with Mocha and Chai.

## Using this repo
Each folder contians a small project to give you practice with basic JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The tests are a guide to help you figure out what you need to do.

It is possible to make the project work without passing the tests.

You should only need to modify the <Project-Name>.js file to complete basic requirement, but you are welcome to modify the html and css files to take the project further.
